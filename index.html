  <h1 id="intro">Konstantin Dmitriev</h1>
  <p>
        My name is Kostya Dmitriev and I'm a Product Designer with focus on web apps. 
        I'm making some designy stuff since 2011. You can read about my working experience 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-dmitriev-89a11b58/?locale=en_US" target="_blank">on Linkedin</a>. 
        I love working on products and trying to make them easier to understand and use.
  </p>
  <p>
      I assume that this is a temporary portfolio. The <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/" target="_blank">best ones</a> I like tell stories: why and how was something built, which decisions were made. Some funny fails and important tradeoffs. Like <a href="https://deuseth.com/" target="_blank">that one time</a>, when we screwed up with smart-contracts. And then realised that we passed on e-mails as the technology of the past and have no contacts of our clients.  
  </p>
  <p>
    So while I'll be writing these stories, check out this image-heavy and very long portfolio with no context mockups. Or let's get in touch and chat:

      MyBit designs products that open up the world, creating tools that enable freedom and wealth generation for everyone. We believe that closed, centrally controlled systems limit our potential as a society, and that truly transparent and open collaboration will power the future.
    </p>
    <p class="white">
      That's sound a bit too broad and generic, isn't it? Yet, it was a value on that MyBit was built. I joined MyBit as the second designer during the long crypto winter. A month later I was the only one left. At MyBit we wanted to reinvent a lot of things but unfortunately, we had not enough resources to do it. But we experimented a lot going from idea to high fidelity prototypes to implement later. 
      With MyBit being open-source I can share all links to prototypes and working files.

    <h2>MyBit Go App</h2>
    <h3>With Go we wanted to re-imagine how people generate income.</h3>
    <p>
        You live in a place where the electricity doesn't cost that much. 
        So you're thinking maybe I can try running a BTC miner? It costs too much and at the moment you can't buy it by yourself, 
        but you have the time and place and willingness. So you go to Go and list your asset. 
        Select the BTC miner model you want, describe potential ROI and risks, add some collateral. 
        After listing the asset anybody can chip in getting ownership of your BTC miner. 
        After successfully funding you run your miner and share the profits with your peers.

        Do you remember how you contributed to a BTC miner on Go and got 10% of the asset? And then realised that this is basically a gold mine and wanted to get some more but there was no place to do it? Yeah, MYDAX will help you. Buy and sell your assets with no prior trading experience. Like just click-click-confirm with Metamask and buy and the same for selling.

      Content Owners have a lot of stuff: books, videos, audios, software & access to their secret services. So they want these things to be easy and quick to access by users in exchange of user's money. Definitely Content Owners are afraid that users will share content with each other without permission. Or even pirates will steal their content. So here we come: we are Aggregion and we protect Content Owner's stuff and help to distribute it to end users. Oh, and also there are Resellers, who want to sell various Content Owners' content to broader audience. And of course there are libraries and universities too, who are willing to share their books, videos etc, but need it to be returnable.

    <p class="blackish">
      Aggregion is quite good at it's job so our clients and partners included Microsoft, Samsung, Intel, Disney and many more small & big publishers and content owners.
